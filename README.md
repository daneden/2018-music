# 2018 Music Project: Oakland/Chinatown Photography

Continuing [the theme](https://github.com/daneden/2017-music) of creating cover art for my monthly Spotify playlists, in 2018 I decided to embark on a photography project: 12 photos of Oakland Chinatownâ€™s street life.

This site uses [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com/) for responsive images, but the rest of the site is more straightforward than 2017: no React, just HTML, CSS, and a [teeny tiny bit of JS](https://github.com/daneden/2018-music/blob/master/script.js).
